# Data-Mining-Project

## How to run

**Step 1:**
Choose a pipeline file that you want to run:
```pipeline_clustering.py```,
```pipeline_dimensionality_reduction.py```, ```pipeline_network.py```

**Step 2 (optional):**
If you want to change the dataset, add a new dataset-path in the dataset-list or remove some of the datasets.

**Step 3:**
Run the pipeline file!

```python pipeline_X.py```


> Note! In pipeline_clustering there are a part of the code that is used in requirements 2 to compare the clustering algorithms before DR and after DR.
